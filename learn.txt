Constructor is a special method that gets called when an object is instantiated from a class. 

There are 5 types of constructor:
  - default constructor
  - parameterized constructor
  - static constructor
  - private constructor
  - copy constructor

Array vs Collection
Array needs to specify the size of an array and can only store the same data type.
Collection can have dynamic collection size and can store different data types.
